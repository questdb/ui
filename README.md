# QuestDB UI

This repository is a monorepo hosting the implementation of QuestDB user
interface and surrounding tooling.

Currently there are these packages:

* [`web-console`](./packages/web-console/README.md) - the GUI tool shipped with QuestDB
* [`react-components`](./packages/react-components/README.md) - small component library for internal reuse between QuestDB products
* [`browser-tests`](./packages/browser-tests/README.md) - a utility based on cypress that helps to automate interactions and assert zero regressions
